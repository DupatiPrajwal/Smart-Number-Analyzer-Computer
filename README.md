# 📟 Advanced Python Calculator & Number Analyzer 

## 📖 Description
This project is a Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations and then analyzes the result mathematically.  
After each calculation, the program checks various properties of the result such as whether it is positive or negative, prime or composite, even or odd, a perfect square, perfect cube, palindrome, or an Armstrong number.

This repository is created as a **beginner-friendly Python project** to practice core programming concepts and logical thinking.
